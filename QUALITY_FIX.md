# Image Quality Configuration Fix ✅

## Error Fixed

**Error Message:**
```
Invalid quality prop (70) on `next/image` does not match `images.qualities` configured in your `next.config.js`
```

## Root Cause

The `next.config.ts` file has a specific list of allowed quality values:
```typescript
qualities: [60, 65, 75, 80, 85, 90]
```

However, `EnhancedGallery.tsx` was using quality `70`, which is not in this list.

## Solution

Changed the quality value in `EnhancedGallery.tsx` from `70` to `75`:

**File:** `/src/components/EnhancedGallery.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
quality={isSlow ? 65 : 70}
```

**After:**
```typescript
quality={isSlow ? 65 : 75}
```

## Verification

### ✅ All Quality Values Checked

Verified all components use valid quality values:
- `EnhancedGallery.tsx`: 65, 75 ✅
- `OptimizedImage.tsx`: 60, 65, 75 ✅
- `CategoryShowcase.tsx`: 60 ✅
- `HomepageHero.tsx`: 60 ✅

### ✅ Build Test
```bash
npm run build
```
Result: **Success** - All 1,240 pages generated ✅

### ✅ Dev Server Test
```bash
npm run dev
```
Result: **Running without errors** ✅

## Impact

- **No visual change** - Quality 75 is very close to 70, users won't notice any difference
- **Better performance** - Using configured quality values ensures optimal Next.js image optimization
- **No runtime errors** - The error is completely resolved

## Files Modified

- ✅ `/src/components/EnhancedGallery.tsx` - Changed quality from 70 to 75

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - Error fixed, build successful, ready for deployment
