✨ 5 Questions to Ask Before Your Nail Appointment ✨

Going to the salon soon? Here's what to consider:

1️⃣ What's your lifestyle? 
   (Active = shorter, stronger shapes)

2️⃣ How long until your next appointment?
   (Schedule affects design complexity)

3️⃣ What's the occasion?
   (Event vs everyday consideration)

4️⃣ Have you seen the design on your hands?
   (What looks good online may not suit everyone)

5️⃣ Are you comfortable asking for changes?
   (Good salons welcome your input!)

💡 Pro tip: Try designs virtually before your appointment 
so you know EXACTLY what you want. Our free AI tool lets 
you preview any design on your actual hands.

## Helpful Response Template

```
[Answer the question directly first - 2-3 sentences]

[Additional helpful context or tips - 2-3 sentences]

If you want to test designs before your appointment, there are 
virtual try-on tools that let you upload a pic of your hand and 
see how different designs would look on you. I've been using one 
called Nail Art AI - it's free and works in your browser. Happy 
to share the link if you're interested!

[Optional: Any other genuine advice]
```

## When Someone Asks "How Can I Preview Designs?"

```
There's actually a really cool free tool for exactly this! 

Nail Art AI lets you upload a photo of your hand and then 
try on different nail art designs virtually. You can see 
how everything from French tips to elaborate designs would 
look on YOUR actual hands before committing at the salon.

Full disclosure: I'm the creator of the tool, so obviously 
I'm biased, but it solves exactly this problem. It's free, 
no downloads needed, works in your browser.

Here's the link if you want to try it: [link]

Let me know if you have any questions!
