# 🏪 Salon Featured Listings - Complete Implementation Guide

**Your Traffic Advantage:**
- 📊 **407k impressions/month** on nail salon queries
- 🔍 Top queries: salon names + "nail salons near me"
- 🎯 This is HIGH-INTENT traffic that salons will pay for!

---

## 📌 What is Featured Listings?

Featured Listings is a monetization model where you charge nail salons for enhanced visibility on your directory pages. Think of it like:
- **Yelp's "Sponsored Results"**
- **Google Maps' "Promoted Pins"**
- **Thumbtack's "Top Pro" badges**

### Why Salons Will Pay:
1. **You rank for their salon name** - When someone searches "Sky Nails" and finds YOUR page, you control that traffic
2. **Local SEO is expensive** - Salons pay $500-2000/month for SEO agencies
3. **Immediate visibility** - They can't easily outrank your established domain
4. **Proof of concept** - Your screenshots show real impressions for salon names!

## ✉️ Email Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Cold Introduction (Short)

```
Subject: Your salon is showing up when people search "nail salons in [City]"

Hi [Name/Team],

I run NailArtAI.app - a nail salon directory that gets 400,000+ monthly views from people searching for nail salons.

Your salon, [Salon Name], is already listed on our site and getting impressions from potential customers.

I wanted to reach out because we now offer Featured Listings for salons who want:
✅ Top placement in local search results
✅ A "Featured" badge to stand out
✅ Photos, services, and booking links displayed
✅ Analytics on how many people view your listing

Starting at just $29/month (less than the cost of one manicure).

Want to see how your listing could look? Reply to this email or visit:
nailartai.app/for-salons

Best,
[Your Name]
NailArtAI.app
```

### Template 2: Data-Driven Outreach

```
Subject: 574 people searched for "Sky Nails" last month

Hi,

I'm reaching out because I noticed something interesting - last month, 574 people searched for "Sky Nails" on Google and saw your listing on my website, NailArtAI.app.

That's 574 potential customers you might be missing out on.

I run the largest nail salon directory website, and I'd love to help you capture more of that traffic with a Featured Listing.

For just $29-79/month, you get:
• Top placement when people search for salons in [City]
• A "Featured" badge that makes you stand out
• Your photos, services, and booking link prominently displayed
• Monthly reports on views and clicks

Would you be interested in a quick 5-minute call to show you how it works?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Template 3: Follow-Up (After No Response)

```
Subject: Quick follow-up about your salon listing

Hi [Name],

Just following up on my email about featuring your salon on NailArtAI.app.

We're currently running a holiday special - 50% off your first month for any listing tier.

That's just $14.50/month for basic or $39.50/month for premium placement.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

---

## 📞 Phone Script (If Calling Salons)

```
"Hi, is this [Salon Name]?"

[Yes]

"Great! My name is [Your Name] and I run NailArtAI.app - it's a website where 
people search for nail salons in their area.

Your salon is actually already listed on our site - we get about 400,000 views 
a month from people looking for nail salons.

I'm calling because we just launched a new Featured Listings program where 
salons can get top placement and stand out from competitors.

Do you have about 2 minutes? I can explain how it works and what it costs."

[If yes, continue:]

"Perfect. So right now, when someone searches for nail salons in [City], they 
see a list of all the salons. With a Featured Listing, your salon would:

1. Show up at the TOP of that list
2. Have a special 'Featured' badge so customers know you're trusted
3. Display your photos, services, and a direct booking link
4. We also send you monthly reports on how many people viewed your listing

Pricing starts at just $29 a month - that's less than what you'd make from 
one new customer who finds you through us.

Would you like to try it for a month and see how it goes? You can cancel anytime."
```

## 🎯 Who to Target First (Prioritization)

### High Priority (Start Here):

1. **Salons you rank for by name** (from Search Console)
   - Sky Nails, Royal Nails, Lovely Nails, etc.
   - They NEED you because you own their search traffic

2. **High-rated salons (4.5+ stars)**
   - They care about reputation
   - More likely to invest in marketing

3. **Salons with websites**
   - Indicates they're marketing-savvy
   - Have budget for online presence

4. **Salons in large cities**
   - More competition = more need to stand out
   - Higher customer volume = higher willingness to pay

### Medium Priority:

5. **New salons** (recently opened)
   - Need to build customer base
   - Open to new marketing channels

6. **Salons with active social media**
   - Already investing in marketing
   - Understand online visibility value

### Lower Priority (Later):

7. **Small town salons** (less competition, less need)
8. **Salons with no web presence** (may not understand value)
