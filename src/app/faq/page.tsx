const generalFAQs = [
  {
    question: "How does the AI nail art generator work?",
    answer: "Our AI analyzes your preferences and generates unique nail art designs using advanced machine learning. Simply describe what you want or browse our gallery for inspiration. The AI creates completely original designs tailored to your style preferences."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I try designs on my own hands?",
    answer: "Yes! Upload a photo of your hand and our virtual try-on feature will show you exactly how different nail designs will look on your actual hands. No commitment, just pure creativity and experimentation."
  },
  {
    question: "Are the designs free to use?",
    answer: "Absolutely! All AI-generated nail art designs are free to use. Download high-resolution images and get detailed instructions for recreating the designs at home or at a salon."
  },
  {
    question: "What nail shapes and styles are supported?",
    answer: "We support all nail shapes including almond, square, coffin, oval, and stiletto. Our AI can create designs for any occasion, season, or style preference - from classic French manicures to bold artistic creations."
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is the virtual try-on?",
    answer: "Our virtual try-on uses advanced AI to realistically apply nail art designs to your hand photos. While results may vary based on photo quality and lighting, it provides an excellent preview of how designs will look."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I save my favorite designs?",
    answer: "Yes! You can save designs to your personal gallery, download them, and even share them on social media. Your saved designs are stored securely and can be accessed anytime."
  }
];

const techniqueFAQs = [
  {
    question: "What's the best way to apply nail art at home?",
    answer: "Start with clean, dry nails and apply a base coat. Use thin layers of polish and allow each layer to dry completely. For detailed designs, use a fine brush or dotting tool. Finish with a top coat to seal and protect your design."
  },
  {
    question: "How long do nail art designs typically last?",
    answer: "With proper application and care, nail art can last 1-2 weeks. Use a quality top coat, avoid prolonged water exposure, and apply cuticle oil daily to maintain your design's longevity."
  },
  {
    question: "What tools do I need for nail art?",
    answer: "Essential tools include base coat, top coat, nail polish in various colors, a fine detail brush, dotting tools, and nail art striping tape. For advanced techniques, consider stamping plates, gel polish, and UV lamp."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I remove nail art safely?",
    answer: "Use acetone-based nail polish remover and cotton pads. Soak the cotton in remover, place on your nail, wrap with foil, and wait 10-15 minutes. Gently push off the softened polish with an orange stick."
  }
];

const troubleshootingFAQs = [
  {
    question: "Why isn't my virtual try-on working?",
    answer: "Ensure your photo has good lighting and your hand is clearly visible. Try taking a new photo with your hand flat and fingers spread. Make sure you're using a supported image format (JPG, PNG)."
  },
  {
    question: "The AI-generated design doesn't match my request. What should I do?",
    answer: "Try being more specific in your description. Include details about colors, patterns, and style preferences. You can also browse our gallery for similar designs and use those as inspiration for your custom request."
  },
  {
    question: "How can I improve the quality of my hand photos?",
    answer: "Use natural lighting when possible, keep your hand steady, and ensure all fingers are visible. Avoid shadows and blurry images. A clean background helps the AI better identify your hand shape."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use the designs for commercial purposes?",
    answer: "Yes, our AI-generated designs are free for personal and commercial use. However, we recommend crediting Nail Art AI when sharing or using designs publicly."
  }
